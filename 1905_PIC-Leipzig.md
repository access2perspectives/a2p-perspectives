Last week in Leipzig at the [MPI-EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html), Corina Logan invited Denis Bourguet and Thomas Guillemaud from [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org/) to give a seminar on their non-profit service to science: 
*A researcher-run solution to improving science and reducing reviewer burden: peer review of preprints and preregistrations at Peer Community In…*


#### The current publication system and preprints
Dr. Denis Bourget

The current system of scientific publications is particularly expensive and not very transparent. Why do we publish and what are the main problems of this system? 
Preprints were presented as one possible solution to the mentioned problems. The presentation answered questions such as: 
- What is a preprint? What are the benefits of using prepints?


#### Peer Community In (PCI): a free public system for peer-reviewing and highlighting preprints
Dr. Thomas Guillemaud

In order to offer an alternative to the current system of publication Thomas, Denis and their co-founder Benoit have initiated the [Peer Community In (PCI) project](https://peercommunityin.org). 
PCI is a non-profit scientific organization that aims to create specific communities of researchers reviewing and recommending, for free, unpublished preprints in their field (i.e. unpublished articles deposited on open online archives like arXiv.org and bioRxiv.org). 
Each PCI is a group of several hundred recommenders playing the role of editors who recommend such preprints based on peer-reviews to make them complete, reliable and citable articles, without the need for publication in ‘traditional’ journals (although the authors can submit their recommended preprints afterwards). Evaluations and recommendations by a PCI are free of charge. When a recommender decides to recommend a preprint, he/she writes a recommendation text that is published along with all the editorial correspondence (reviews, recommender's decisions, authors’ replies). The preprint itself is not published by PCI: it remains in the preprint server where it was posted by the authors. 
The first Peer Community In was launched in 2017: [Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology](https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/) (PCI Evol Biol) and more than 380 recommenders have already joined. 
[PCI Paleontology](https://paleo.peercommunityin.org/) and [PCI Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/) were launched in January 2018 and the latter already has 280 recommenders.

### Doing science forward: peer review of preregistrations at PCI Ecology
Dr. Corina Logan

[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com/) shared how she made her research program open and transparent to make it better and faster through the use of [preregistrations](https://cos.io/prereg/?_ga=2.4968435.1523402731.1558346279-1923525435.1510230389).
In a preregisteration you basically state your study goals, methods, and analysis plan before you start collecting data. Corina was able to take this a step further by creating the opportunity for researchers to have preregistrations peer reviewed at [PCI Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/). 
How this process at PCI works, as well as how one might go about preregistering different types of research outputs (e.g., exploratory research, systematic reviews) is shown in her presentation at [osf.io/bstph](https://osf.io/bstph/)
